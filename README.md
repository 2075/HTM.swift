# HTM.swift
porting of the Nupic/HTM algorithms to Swift

Join the chat at https://gitter.im/2075/HTM.swift

This aims to be a complete port of the CLA infrastructure and implementations to Swift.

Why do this?

Since Swift is not client only anymore and like Julia a performant and well developed language, it deserves its own port, like Julia (If you are interested in the Julia version, go here: https://github.com/nupic-community/HTM.Julia)

Furthermore it is a learning project for myself aswell, as almost nothing exists in ML/AI for Swift Language.

Feel free to join the show, especially feature requests are welcome.
